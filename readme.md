# Introduction to C++

This is a quick guide to introduce you to programming in C++. It's being written
for James. It assumes you've written some code before (maybe MATLAB), 
but nothing specific.

It aims to present good practice for "modern" C++, but points out the old
ways of doing things if you're likely to see them a lot.

It comes with no guarantees of being correct, complete or accurate, and probably
contains lots of subjective opinions.
